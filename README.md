# IMLBoost
A new Imbalance Lessened Boosting (IMLBoost) algorithm is  proposed to better classify imbalanced medical records, highlighting the  contribution of samples in minor classes as well as hard and boundary  samples. We have presented a Cost-Fitting Loss (CFL) function to  assign befitting costs to these critical samples.
